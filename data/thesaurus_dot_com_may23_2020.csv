The coincidence in meaning with Old Norse *bulki , Icelandic búlki ‘heap, cargo of a ship’ (Vigfusson), Danish bulk lump, clod (compare modern Icelandic búlka-st to be bulky), suggests that the word, though not recorded before 15th cent., may (in the senses ‘heap’, ‘cargo’) be of Scandinavian origin. Within a few years of its first appearance, bulk occurs in the senses ‘belly, trunk of the body’, due apparently to confusion with bouk n., which word it has entirely superseded in literary English.

The coincidence in meaning with Old Norse *bulki , Icelandic búlki ‘heap, cargo of a ship’ (Vigfusson), Danish bulk lump, clod (compare modern Icelandic búlka-st to be bulky), suggests that the word, though not recorded before 15th cent., may (in the senses ‘heap’, ‘cargo’) be of Scandinavian origin. Within a few years of its first appearance, bulk occurs in the senses ‘belly, trunk of the body’, due apparently to confusion with bouk n., which word it has entirely superseded in literary English. (Compare however, the Flemish bulck ‘thorax’ in Kilian.) The sense of ‘size’ (branch III) seems to have been evolved chiefly from the notion of ‘body’, though it may be partly due to that of ‘heap’ or ‘cargo’. The form boak, used by N. Fairfax 1674 indiscriminately with bulk in the sense of ‘magnitude’, is apparently < Middle English bolk.",probably Scandinavian,none,c1440,c1440,Middle English
